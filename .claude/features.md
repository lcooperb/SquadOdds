## üéØ Core Betting System

### Credit-Based Betting
**No wallet balance, bet on credit with payment obligations on resolution.**

**How It Works:**
- Users can place individual bets up to **$300** without managing a wallet
- No top-ups or withdrawals required
- Portfolio tracks total value of active positions
- When markets resolve, losers owe winners (settled privately)

**Key Concepts:**
```typescript
// Bet Placement
- Maximum: $300 per individual bet
- No balance check required
- Creates ACTIVE bet immediately

// Portfolio Calculation
Portfolio = Sum of all ACTIVE bets on ACTIVE markets

// Resolution
- Winning bets ‚Üí Removed from portfolio, user is winner
- Losing bets ‚Üí Removed from portfolio, user owes winners
- Cancelled bets ‚Üí Removed from portfolio, no obligations
```

**Status Flow:**
1. **ACTIVE** ‚Üí Bet placed on active market (in portfolio)
2. **WON** ‚Üí Market resolved in favor (out of portfolio, winner)
3. **LOST** ‚Üí Market resolved against (out of portfolio, owes payment)
4. **REFUNDED** ‚Üí Market cancelled (out of portfolio, no payment)

## üìä Market Types

### Binary Markets (YES/NO)
**Simple prediction with two outcomes.**

**Features:**
- Single question with YES or NO answer
- YES price displayed as probability (0-100%)
- NO price = 100 - YES price
- Users bet on either side
- Market resolves to YES (true) or NO (false)

**Example:**
```
Question: "Will Alice get promoted by end of year?"
YES: 65% | NO: 35%
Users can bet on YES or NO
Resolution: Admin marks as YES or NO
```

**UI Elements:**
- Large YES/NO buttons (side-by-side on desktop, modal on mobile)
- Real-time price display
- Auto-selects highest probability side by default
- Price chart showing YES probability over time

### Multiple Choice Markets
**Prediction with 3+ possible outcomes.**

**Features:**
- Multiple options (e.g., "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
- Each option has its own probability
- All probabilities sum to 100%
- Users bet YES on specific options
- Market resolves to one winning option

**Example:**
```
Question: "Who will get promoted first?"
Options:
- Alice: 45%
- Bob: 35%
- Charlie: 20%

User bets YES on "Alice"
Resolution: Admin selects winning option (e.g., "Bob")
```

**UI Elements:**
- List of options with individual prices
- Bet YES on each option independently
- Multi-line price chart (one line per option)
- Synchronized price updates (all options move together to maintain 100% sum)

---

## üíπ Automated Market Maker (AMM)

### Dynamic Pricing
**Prices adjust automatically based on betting activity.**

**Key Features:**
- **Market Impact:** Larger bets move prices more
- **Slippage:** Price increases as you buy (execution price > market price)
- **Adaptive Liquidity:** Small markets get virtual liquidity boost
- **Multi-Slice Execution:** Large trades split across price levels

**How It Works:**
```typescript
1. User places $100 bet on YES at 50%
2. System calculates market impact based on:
   - Bet size ($100)
   - Current price (50%)
   - Total market volume
3. Price moves to ~52% (depending on volume)
4. User gets average execution price (~51%)
5. Market price updates for next bettor
```

**Price Impact Factors:**
- **Bet Size:** Bigger bets = bigger price moves
- **Market Volume:** Higher volume = less impact
- **Current Price:** Extreme prices (near 0% or 100%) move less
- **Market Size:** Micro markets (<$200) get liquidity boost to prevent wild swings

**Example Scenarios:**

*Small Market ($100 volume):*
- $20 bet on YES @ 50% ‚Üí Price moves to ~52% (2% impact)

*Large Market ($5,000 volume):*
- $20 bet on YES @ 50% ‚Üí Price moves to ~50.2% (0.2% impact)

*Large Bet on Small Market:*
- $100 bet on YES @ 50% in $200 market ‚Üí Price moves to ~58% (8% impact)
- Bet executes across multiple price levels (slicing)

---

## üí∞ Buy/Sell Positions

### Buy (Open Position)
**Enter a new position in the market.**

**Features:**
- Buy YES or NO shares
- Up to $300 per transaction
- Price impact applies (execution price > market price)
- Position added to portfolio
- Market volume increases

**Example:**
```
Buy $100 YES @ 60%
‚Üí Position: $100 YES
‚Üí Portfolio: +$100
‚Üí Market: Price moves up, volume +$100
```

### Sell (Close Position)
**Exit an existing position.**

**Features:**
- Sell YES or NO shares you own
- Can't sell more than owned position
- Receive position value back
- Position removed from portfolio
- Market volume decreases
- Reverse price impact (price moves down when selling YES)

**Example:**
```
Own: $100 YES position
Sell $50 YES @ 65%
‚Üí Position: $50 YES remaining
‚Üí Portfolio: -$50
‚Üí Receive: $50 payout
‚Üí Market: Price moves down slightly, volume -$50
```

**Validation:**
- System checks net position before allowing sell
- Example: If you have $100 YES and $30 YES (bought twice), net position is $130 YES
- Can sell up to $130 YES

## üèÜ Market Resolution & Payments

### Resolution Process
**Admin determines market outcome, system calculates payments.**

**Binary Markets:**
1. Admin clicks "Resolve Market"
2. Selects outcome: YES or NO
3. System:
   - Marks winning bets as WON
   - Marks losing bets as LOST
   - Removes all bets from portfolios
   - Calculates payment obligations
   - Sends notifications

**Multiple Choice Markets:**
1. Admin selects winning option
2. System:
   - Marks bets on winning option as WON
   - Marks all other bets as LOST
   - Removes all bets from portfolios
   - Calculates payments
   - Sends notifications

### Payment Obligations
**Proportional distribution: Each loser pays winners based on their bet sizes.**

**Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
Example Market:
- Alice bet $100 YES (winner)
- Bob bet $50 YES (winner)
- Charlie bet $60 NO (loser)

Total winning bets: $150
Alice's share: $100 / $150 = 66.67%
Bob's share: $50 / $150 = 33.33%

Charlie's $60 distributed:
- Charlie owes Alice: $60 √ó 66.67% = $40
- Charlie owes Bob: $60 √ó 33.33% = $20
```

**Payment Display:**
- **Market Detail Page:** Full payment matrix showing all obligations
- **Notifications:**
  - Winners: "You won $100. You'll receive $40 from Charlie."
  - Losers: "You lost $60. You owe $40 to Alice, $20 to Bob."

**Settlement:**
- Payments settled privately between users
- Platform does not process actual money transfers
- Users can use Venmo, Cash App, etc.

### Market Cancellation
**Admin can void a market with no payments.**

**Process:**
1. Admin clicks "Cancel Market"
2. Confirms cancellation
3. System:
   - Sets market status to CANCELLED
   - Marks all bets as REFUNDED (voided)
   - Removes all bets from portfolios
   - No payment obligations created
   - Sends cancellation notifications

**Use Cases:**
- Market became invalid (e.g., event already happened)
