## [2.0.0] - Major System Overhaul - September 2024

### üîÑ BREAKING CHANGE: Wallet ‚Üí Credit System Migration

**Complete removal of wallet balance management in favor of credit-based betting.**

#### What Changed
- ‚ùå **REMOVED:** Virtual wallet balance system
  - No more balance top-ups or withdrawals
  - No payment/redemption processing in-app
  - Removed Payment and Redemption models from admin panel
  - Removed virtualBalance display from UI

- ‚úÖ **ADDED:** Credit-based betting system
  - $300 maximum per individual bet
  - No wallet balance checks required
  - Users bet on credit with payment obligations on resolution
  - Portfolio = sum of ACTIVE bets on ACTIVE markets (no stored balance)

#### Migration Impact
- **Database:** `User.virtualBalance` field still exists but is NOT used in calculations
- **API Routes:** All balance checks and updates removed from betting flow
- **Admin Panel:** Payments and Redemptions tabs completely removed
- **UI:** All balance displays replaced with portfolio displays

#### Code Changes
```typescript
// OLD (removed):
if (user.virtualBalance < betAmount) {
  return error('Insufficient balance');
}
await updateUserBalance(-betAmount);

// NEW (current):
if (betAmount > 300) {
  return error('Maximum bet is $300');
}
// No balance operations - just create bet on credit
```

## [1.8.0] - Payment Tracking System - September 2024

### Added: Payment Obligations on Market Resolution

**Markets now calculate and display who owes who when resolved.**

#### Features Added
- **Payment Calculation Logic** (`src/app/api/events/[id]/resolve/route.ts`)
  - Proportional distribution: Each loser's bet distributed to winners based on their winning bet sizes
  - Returns payment matrix in resolution response

- **Enhanced Notifications** (`src/lib/notifications.ts`)
  - Winners notified with list of who owes them and amounts
  - Losers notified with list of who they need to pay
  - Example: "You won $50. You'll receive $75 from: Bob ($50), Alice ($25)"

- **Payment Breakdown UI** (`src/app/market/[id]/page.tsx`)
  - New section on resolved market pages showing full payment matrix
  - Displays "Alice owes Bob: $50.00" for each payment obligation
  - Note clarifying payments are settled privately

#### Example Payment Calculation
```typescript
// If Alice bet $100 YES and Bob bet $50 YES (winners)
// Charlie bet $60 NO (loser)
// Charlie's $60 distributed: Alice gets $40, Bob gets $20
const winnerShare = winningBet.amount / totalWinningAmount;
const payment = losingBet.amount * winnerShare;
```

## [1.4.0] - AMM Improvements - August 2024

### Enhanced: Market Impact System

**More realistic pricing with improved slippage and liquidity.**

#### Changes to `src/lib/marketImpact.ts`
- **Adaptive liquidity system** with floors for small markets
- **Progressive scaling** based on market size (micro/small/medium)
- **Reduced slippage** for small markets to prevent extreme volatility
- **Market size multiplier** caps slippage for tiny markets (0.4-1.0 range)
- **Multi-slice execution** for large trades (splits across price levels)

#### Example
```typescript
// Micro markets (<$200 volume): Significant liquidity boost
scaledLiquidity = minLiquidity + Math.log(totalVolume + 1) * 60;

// Market size multiplier prevents extreme price swings
const marketSizeMultiplier = totalVolume < 500
  ? Math.max(0.4, totalVolume / 1250)
  : 1.0;
```
