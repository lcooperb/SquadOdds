## üí∞ Credit-Based Betting System

**Core Concept:** Users bet on credit without managing a wallet balance.

### Key Features
- **No Wallet Balance:** Users do not top up or withdraw funds
- **$300 Per-Bet Limit:** Each individual bet is limited to $300
- **Portfolio Calculation:** Portfolio = sum of ACTIVE bets on ACTIVE markets
- **Payment Obligations:** When markets resolve, losers owe winners based on proportional distribution
- **No Real Money Flow:** All betting is on credit; payment obligations settled externally

### Bet Lifecycle
1. **ACTIVE:** Bet is placed on an active market (added to portfolio)
2. **WON:** Market resolved in user's favor (removed from portfolio, winner)
3. **LOST:** Market resolved against user (removed from portfolio, loser)
4. **REFUNDED:** Market cancelled/voided (removed from portfolio, no payout)

### Portfolio Logic
```typescript
// Portfolio = sum of ACTIVE bets' amounts on ACTIVE markets
const activeBets = user.bets.filter(b =>
  b.status === 'ACTIVE' && b.event.status === 'ACTIVE'
);
const portfolio = activeBets.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b.amount, 0);
```

## üìä Automated Market Maker (AMM)

SquadOdds uses a custom AMM for dynamic pricing with realistic market depth and slippage.

### Pricing Model
- **Binary Markets:** YES/NO probabilities (0-100%)
- **Multiple Choice Markets:** Options sum to 100% probability
- **Market Impact:** Larger bets move prices more (slippage)
- **Liquidity Scaling:** Small markets get virtual liquidity boost to prevent extreme volatility

### Key Calculations
```typescript
// Market impact increases with bet size relative to total volume
const impactFactor = betAmount / scaledLiquidity;
const slippage = Math.sqrt(rawSlippage) * scalingFactor;
const newPrice = currentPrice + slippage; // For YES bets
```

See `src/lib/marketImpact.ts` for full AMM implementation.

## üéØ Market Types

### Binary Markets
- **YES/NO outcomes**
- Single probability (YES price)
- NO price = 100 - YES price
- Users bet on YES or NO side

### Multiple Choice Markets
- **3+ options** (e.g., "Who will get promoted first? Alice, Bob, Charlie")
- Each option has its own probability
- All option probabilities sum to 100%
- Users bet YES on specific options

## üí∏ Payment Obligations

When markets resolve, the system calculates who owes who based on **proportional distribution**.

### Payment Calculation
```typescript
// Each loser's bet amount is distributed proportionally to winners
losingBets.forEach(losingBet => {
  winningBets.forEach(winningBet => {
    const winnerShare = winningBet.amount / totalWinningAmount;
    const paymentAmount = losingBet.amount * winnerShare;

    payments.push({
      from: losingBet.user,
      to: winningBet.user,
      amount: paymentAmount
    });
  });
});
```

### Payment Display
- **Notifications:** Users get personalized messages ("You owe Bob $50", "Alice owes you $30")
- **Market Detail Pages:** Payment breakdown shows full payment matrix
- **Note:** Payments are settled privately between users (no platform involvement)

## üîî Notification System

Real-time notifications for market events with personalized payment details.

### Notification Types
- `MARKET_CLOSED`: Market has closed for betting
- `MARKET_RESOLVED`: Market resolved with outcome and payment obligations
- `MARKET_CANCELLED`: Market voided, bets removed from portfolios

### Resolution Notifications
Winners and losers receive different messages:
- **Winners:** "You won $50. You'll receive $75 from: Bob ($50), Alice ($25)"
- **Losers:** "You lost $50. You owe $50 to: Charlie"

See `src/lib/notifications.ts` for implementation.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (Prisma)

### Core Models
- **User:** email, name, isAdmin, appleCashEmail (for external payments)
- **Event:** title, description, marketType (BINARY/MULTIPLE), status (ACTIVE/CLOSED/RESOLVED/CANCELLED)
- **Bet:** userId, eventId, side (YES/NO), amount, price, shares (position value), status
- **MarketOption:** For multiple choice markets (title, price, totalVolume)
- **Notification:** userId, type, message, data (structured JSON)
- **Comment:** eventId, userId, content, parentId (for threading)

### Important Fields
- **Event.yesPrice:** Current YES probability (0-100) for binary markets
- **Event.outcome:** true = YES won, false = NO won, null = not resolved
- **Event.winningOptionId:** ID of winning option for multiple choice markets
- **Bet.shares:** Stores position value in AMM model (can be negative for SELL operations)
- **Bet.status:** ACTIVE, WON, LOST, REFUNDED

See `prisma/schema.prisma` for complete schema.

## üîê Authentication

NextAuth.js with credential provider and bcrypt password hashing.

### User Roles
- **Regular Users:** Can create markets, place bets, comment
- **Admins:** Additional access to admin panel for user/market management (set via `isAdmin` boolean)

### Session Management
```typescript
// Session includes user ID, email, name, isAdmin flag
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session?.user) {
  return unauthorized();
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Patterns

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop:** Side-by-side betting interface (BettingCard)
- **Mobile:** Modal-based betting (BettingModal)
- **Large buttons:** Touch-friendly on all devices

### Color System
- **Green:** Positive values (profits, winnings, portfolio)
- **Red:** Negative values (losses)
- **Blue:** Primary actions (Create Market, Place Bet)
- **Purple:** Category filters
- **Muted backgrounds:** Gray-800/90 for better hierarchy

### Key Components
- **Navigation:** Shows portfolio value in real-time
- **MarketCard:** Market preview with price, volume, category
- **PriceChart:** Interactive Recharts line graph
- **NotificationDropdown:** Bell icon with unread count

- **Markets Created:** Count of events created

### Leaderboard
Ranked by portfolio value, with secondary sorting by net profit.
